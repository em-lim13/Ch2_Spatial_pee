# Load data -------------
# This is a combo file of Jasmin/Em/Siobhan 2021 data and KCCA 2022 data
# If you just download your RLS data from google drive as a csv this should work

rls <- read_csv("Data/RLS/updated_RLS_KCCA.csv") %>%
  select(-1) %>% # cuts the first column which is blank
  select(-Inverts) %>% # cuts the inverts column which is just NAs
  filter(Method != 0) %>% # get rid of all method 0's
  slice(2:n()) %>% # cuts the first blank row
  rename(
    site_ID = `Site No.`,
    site_name = `Site Name`, 
    common_name = `Common name`

  filter(Species != "Survey not completed") %>%
  filter(Species != "No species found") %>%
  filter(Species != "No species found") %>%

# Neat data manipulations ------

# What's the most abundant species?
rls_abundant_species <- rls %>% group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(sum = sum(Total))  %>% arrange(desc(sum))

# Which site has the most species?
rls_richness <- rls %>%

# where are the most urchins???
# Can swap for any species

  summarize(urchins = sum(Total)) %>%
  arrange(desc(urchins))

# So basically you can manipulate the data to summarize whatever thing you're interested in, and then you can join that summarized data with another df of interest by the common site code/site name :)

# Claire you probably want to stop here what follows is a crime against humanity
# Basically I tried to guess how much the more abundant species would weigh and see where biomss was highest

# Very heinous mass estimates ------
