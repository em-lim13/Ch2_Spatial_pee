# Biomass calculations -------

# A note on length to weight relationships
# The overall relationship is W = a*L^b
# log form of the above formula is log(W) = log(a) + b*log(L)
# The Siegel paper presents the log transformed a value
# Eg if the Siegel paper says a = -4.60517 that corresponds to log(0.01)
# So some papers will present a already log transformed (a negative value) and some will present a as an untransformed value (positive decimal)
# log(W) = log(a) + b*log(L) is the same as log10(W) = log10(a) + b*log10(L) so don't worry about the base as long as it's the same across the formula

# Use the a and b parameters from FishBase
# W = a*L^b
# log form of the above formula is log(W) = log(a) + b*log(L)
# W = exp(log(a) + b*log(L))

### BMSC5 2022: two surveys at same depth, one nh4 sample
# I was on the later shallower survey
### BMSC6 2022: two surveys at same depth, two nh4 samples!
### BMSC11 2022: two survey depths, one nh4 sample 
### BMSC12 2022: two survey depths, one nh4 sample 
### BMSC11 2023: two survey depths, one nh4 sample 
# I tried to take nh4 samples between the shallower and deeper surveys
### BMSC12 2023: two survey depths, one nh4 sample 
# I tried to take nh4 samples between the shallower and deeper surveys
# BMSC24 2023: two survey depths, one nh4 sample
# I tried to take nh4 samples between the shallower and deeper surveys
# BMSC25 2023: two survey depths, one nh4 sample
# these two were back to back, don't average
# BMSC26 2023: two survey depths, one nh4  (only 2 pee reps tho)
# these two were back to back, don't average
# I was with the 10 m team that got in first
# BMSC27 2023: two survey depths, one nh4 sample
