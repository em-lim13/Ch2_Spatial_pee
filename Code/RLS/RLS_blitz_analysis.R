# RLS Biomass calculations -------

# A note on length to weight relationships
# The overall relationship is W = a*L^b
# log form of the above formula is log(W) = log(a) + b*log(L)
# log(W) = log(a) + b*log(L) is the same as log10(W) = log10(a) + b*log10(L) so don't worry about the base as long as it's the same across the formula

# Use the a and b parameters from FishBase
# W = exp(log(a) + b*log(L))

# Stats -------

# Step 0: Ask my question
  # Is there a link between biodiversity or biomass and ammonium concentration?

# Response variable: nh4_avg
  # this is the mean of 3 measurements, how do I incorporate that error in the models?

# Step 1: Choose a distribution
ggplot(rls_final, aes(x = nh4_avg)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) 

# NH4 is positive only and continuous (not intergers) 
# Gamma is likely the best bet for this!

# Step 2: Choose your predictors

# Biological predictors:
# 1) Biomass
    # a) weight_sum = total wet weight of all the animals observed on RLS transects
    # b) all_weight_weighted = weighted fish weight + invert weight
        # Weight sum and weight weighted are barely different
    # c) fish_weight_sum = total wet weight of just the fishes (kg)
    # d) fish_weight_weighted = total weight of fishes weighted by home range size
# I'm going with weight_sum

# 2) Biodiversity
    # a) species_richness = total # species on each transect
    # b) shannon = shannon diversity of each transect
    # c) simpson = simpson diversity of each transect
# I'm going with shannon
    
# These are the variables I really care about!!!! The abiotics are the things I might need to control for

# Continuous abiotic predictors
  # 1) depth_avg = average nh4 sample depths
  # 2) avg_exchange_rate = average rate of change of the tide height over the 1 hour survey

# Categorical abiotic predictors
  # 3) year = 2021, 2022, or 2023
  # 4) site_code = each unique site
    # should year and site be fixed or random effects?
      # interested trends across a broad spatial scale (and not site-specific trends) so site should be random
      # so year should also be random???

# Interactions
  # I think whatever biomass and biodiversity variable I choose should have an interaction with exchange rate
