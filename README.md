# Ch3_Spatial_pee
Everything for my spatial ammonium variation chapter

Code Files:

Analyses for each of the three main sections of this paper:
1) RLS_blitz_analysis.R contains code for the among site, meso-scale experiment
2) Kelp_pee_analysis.R contains code for the within site, small-scale experiment
3) Cage_pee_analysis.R contains code for the within-meters, smallest-scale experiment


Ammonium calculations for each of the 3 above sections can be found in the Pee_calculations folder. Each section has it's own file where I calculate ammonium concentrations from the seawater samples which we analysed using fluorometry. 

Functions are stored in Functions.R, which is called at the beginning of each file.

Maps.R contains code to generate the map in Figure 1 and additional maps for presentations.
